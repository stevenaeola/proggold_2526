## Task summary

- Construct a dynamic web site for an application of your choosing
- Use static HTML pages loading dynamic JSON content from server via AJAX
- Server written in nodejs to provide JSON through REST API
- Prepare a 2 minute video demonstrating your code

---

### Dynamic web site

- Choose any application domain as long as it includes at least two kinds of entity e.g.
  - pictures
  - people
  - places
  - events
  - comments
- Could be e.g. club, social, health, gallery
- Feedback on choice of application through formative assignment

---

### Static HTML loading JSON via AJAX

- 'Single page app': page content loaded as JSON via AJAX
- Can have more than one page e.g. for user and admin
- Should provide clean and simple User Experience (UX)
- Should be responsive i.e. work well on desktop and mobile
- Recommend using front-end framework such as Bootstrap, Foundation
- Do not use non-standard language extensions e.g. React, TypeScript

---

### Server provides JSON through a REST API

Each entity type (e.g. picture) has 

- GET method to list/search (returns a list of ids and names)
- GET method for individual details (includes details of related entities)
- POST method to add new entity (one entity type will be enough)


---

- Document your API in the style of the [ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/)
- see [other good API docs](https://nordicapis.com/5-examples-of-excellent-api-documentation/)
- Response provided as JSON
- Content-type needs to be correct
- HTTP codes should be correct: use 200, 400 or 403 (if using authentication)

---

### Server written in nodejs

- Use npm for management
- Make sure you use --save or --save-dev option with packages you add
- Write jest test cases: run with `npm test`
- Recommend using express

---

## Submission

Source code (all zipped)

- HTML and CSS and any media
- Client and server side JavaScript
- package.json including test and pretest scripts
- jest test cases e.g. app.test.js
- documentation of API
- demonstration video 

Should not include `node_modules` in submission

---

## Assessment Criteria

Equally weighted 20% of assignment mark each

- Client-side functionality
- Client-side quality
- Server-side functionality
- Server-side quality
- Video presentation

---

### Client-side functionality criteria

- User Experience (UX): clean layout and minimal clicks/entry required
- App complexity: entities can be listed and edited
- 'Single page' style: asynchronous updates

---

### Client-side quality criteria

- Standards compliant (HTML5)
- Responsive to different viewport sizes
- Gracefully handles server disconnection
  - useful error messages
  - recommences on server restart

---

### Server-side functionality criteria

- More than one entity type, with relationships
- REST API provides each entity with appropriate GET/POST methods
- Installs with `npm install`
- Starts with `npm start`

---

### Server-side quality criteria

- Successful jest tests with good coverage (run with `npm test`)
- Testing includes content-type and HTTP code
- Completeness of API documentation 

---

## Video Presentation

- Submit a 2 minute (max) video demonstrating your software
- Include demonstration of how to start the program
- All functionality will be assessed by what is demonstrated in the video
- If it is not demonstrated in the video, you will not get a mark for it
- Quality of video presentation will be marked separately from functionality:
  - Structure; Visual Presentation; Audio explanation
- Lose 10% of marks for every 10 seconds over 2 minutes

---
